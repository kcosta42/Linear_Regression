# Linear_Regression

About
-----
> This project will be our first steps into AI and Machine Learning. We're going to start with a simple, basic machine learning algorithm.
>
>We will have to create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm.

This is the first project of the Artificial Intelligence branch at School 42 Paris
